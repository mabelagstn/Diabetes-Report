# Diabetes Report
In this project, I analysed the best classifier to predict diabetes status based on a dataset of 100,000 survey responses. 
The dataset included eight key features: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 
The goal was to identify the best classifier for accurately predicting diabetes status, with a focus on minimizing the False Negative Rate (FNR) to ensure early detection and treatment of diabetes.

Key highlights:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess the association between each input variable and diabetes status using contingency tables and proportion analysis.
- Implemented and evaluated three machine learning classifiers: Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.
- Utilized performance metrics such as ROC curves, AUC values, and FNR to determine the most effective model.
- Identified Logistic Regression as the best-performing classifier, achieving the highest AUC value (0.96) and the lowest FNR (0.11), ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.
- Provided a detailed comparison of the classifiers, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach.
